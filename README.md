# Solving Frozen Lake MDP

Solving the [Markov Decision Process model of the gym's FrozenLage-v0 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/) using value iteration and policy iteration. Week 2 homework for the `#move37` course. Decided to use this environment because it worked well with Jupyter notebooks without doing anything extra. And I decided to use a Jupyter notebook because I didn't want to just code the algorithm but also put some notes. 


You can see the resulting notebook at [notebooks/DynamicProgramming.ipynb](https://github.com/carlosdg/SolvingFrozenLakeV0/blob/master/notebooks/DynamicProgramming.ipynb)


To run the Jupyter server via docker: `docker-compose up`.
